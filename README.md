# Central Idea
The core idea of this web app is to mark your daily routine objects in real world and real time, for instance you park your car in a heavely crowded parking area or you put your stuff randomly in your college, then all you have to do in order to remember where it was placed is to mark their real world locations on our app and then you never loose the sight of them, even if you do then all you have to do is use this web app to reach back to them in one tap.

this is how it looks, it is strictly made using Google Maps Api also when u walk it towards your marked object, the page renders itself accordingly similar to how uber UI works.

# Contribution
- The "web app" is made using react, and it would be much better if it were made using react native and was for smart phones, see the problem with google maps api is that it takes lats and lngs for locating you. You don't get the most accurate geo encoding with browser, but using a mobile phone you get GPS built in your phone and hence the geo encoding is wayyyy more precise with it, hence this can be turned into a mobile app.

- A NoSql DB can be connected to it and/or local storage can be made.
